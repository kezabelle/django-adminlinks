0.8.1 / 2013-11-13 (40 commits)
===============================

* Provide better state recognition to detect whether the iframe
  should autoclose, across requests.
* A bunch of changes to the CSS/JS handling.

0.8.0 / 2013-08-01 (128 commits)
================================

An almost complete rebuild since the incomplete version 0.1.0.
See [the GitHub commit history](https://github.com/kezabelle/django-adminlinks/commits/576956e6db3fe16bcc6d7029a7ac2b0f2aa2d545) for a complete
list of changes, the [source at this point in time](https://github.com/kezabelle/django-adminlinks/tree/576956e6db3fe16bcc6d7029a7ac2b0f2aa2d545),
and [the GitHub diff between now and the previously published push](https://github.com/kezabelle/django-adminlinks/compare/80f7b234f879ec2a2fb350443e4b591807386b0d...576956e6db3fe16bcc6d7029a7ac2b0f2aa2d545),
because I'm seriously not going to enumerate everything that's changed. I can't
even remember that far back!
